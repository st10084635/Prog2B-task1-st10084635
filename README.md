FAQ's

1.
Q: When I try to update my hours after I added a module it givs me an error. How do I fix this?
A: There can be multiple reasons why this is happening. One of the reasons can be that you misspelled your course code when you try to update the self study hours. The other reason can be because of the date format that is used when you insert the date, the correct format to use in this application is "mm/dd/yyyy".

2.
Q: Why can,t I update multiple modules self study hours remaining but ai can insert multiple modules?
A: Because this is the first version of the application there will be some issues with it this is one of them that has not been sorted out so for the time being you can only adjust the self study hours of one module at a time.


3.
Q: Why can't I update my self study hours per week? It keeps coming up with an error that says something about course code.
A: The reason for this can be because you have not added a module yet, the other reason for this can be because the application does not persist data in between runs as of yet, so all the modules that you have already added previously and then closed the application will not be saved.
